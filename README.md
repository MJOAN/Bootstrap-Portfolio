# Responsiveness Assignment

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create two different portfolios. The first will be an update of the one you made last week. You'll enhance the portfolio you made last week with a mobile-responsive layout. For your second portfolio, youâ€™ll build a layout using the Bootstrap CSS framework.

### Before You Begin

* You've learned a ton of material these past two weeks: HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap. If you feel like you're falling behind, there's no need to panic. You'll have 22 weeks to digest and master this material.

* We're diving into JavaScript next week, and HTML/CSS will start receiving less focus. Still, you'll find that a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS will help you understand JavaScript, especially when we use it to manipulate web pages.

### Instructions

1. Create two new GitHub repositories and name them `Responsive-Portfolio` and `Bootstrap-Portfolio`.

2. Clone these repositories to your computer.

3. Copy the contents of `Basic-Portfolio` (your first homework solution) and paste the mentioned files into `Responsive-Portfolio`.

4. Note: Be sure not to include any dot files (e.g. .git, .gitignore) from the `Basic-Portfolio` repo.

5. If you chose the `Skeleton` exercise for your first homework assignment, contact a TA, who will provide you with a template for your portfolio.

### Assignment Two Instructions (Bootstrap)

1. Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

2. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)

     * eg. On `xs` and `sm` screens, each section should take up the entire grid. On `m` and larger screens, each section should take up 2/3 of the grid and the sidebar should take up 1/3 of the grid

   * Responsive images

**BONUS**
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-solumns on your portfolio site _(Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)_

3. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

4. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.

### Submitting Your Work on [BootcampSpot.com](http://bootcampspot.com/)

1. Submit the GitHub links to your portfolio repositories on GitHub.

2. Submit the link to your (GitHub Pages) deployed site in the same input field.

### BONUS

* Incorporate CSS animations in your portfolio. [More info here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).
